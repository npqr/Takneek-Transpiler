# Takneek Transpiler

Developed a transpiler in python for converting from [SuperStack](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Super_Stack!) to [IITK Traveller](https://iitk-traveller-docs.netlify.app/) ([Source](https://github.com/pclubiitk/IITK-Traveller)), a unique graph-based esolang with 56 interconnected functions, incorporating basic functions and a highly optimized push function as a part of the Takneek 2023 Transpiler PS.

The implemented code in python is available in the file [`trans.py`](/trans.py)
